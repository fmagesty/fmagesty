      <p>
        I've been coding every single day since I begin and loving every minute
        of it as I'm constantly learning more each day. I unwind playing a game
        or listening to music. Or both. Reading, watching content or talking to
        other people about coding and technology in general is what keeps me
        excited to go back to my computer and do something new with it,
        sometimes just to mess with old projects or solve some logic exercises
        in order to not get rusty. I don't know what else to say about myself
        but feel free to ask me if you want to know more.
      </p>
