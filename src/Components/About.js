      <p>
        Recently I've been coding every day, and started to drink tea and liked
        it. I unwind playing a game or listening to music. Or both. Reading,
        watching content or talking to other people about coding and technology
        in general is what keeps me excited to go back to my computer and do
        some more coding, sometimes just mess with old projects or solve some
        logic exercises in order to not get rusty. I don't know what else to say
        so just ask if you want to learn more.
