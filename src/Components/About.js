      <p>
        Recently I've been coding everyday, and recently started to drink tea
        and liked it. I also relax playing a game or listening to music. Or
        both. Reading or watching content or talking to other people about
        coding and technology in general is what keeps me excited to go back to
        my computer and do some more coding, sometimes just mess with old
        projects. I don't know what else to say so just ask if you want to learn
        more.
      </p>
